# 🧩 CTF Writeups & Practice Repository

This repository contains my **solutions, notes, and writeups** for various **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges and cybersecurity labs that I solve while learning and practicing offensive and defensive security concepts.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Sharpen practical cybersecurity skills  
- Document clear thought processes & methodologies  
- Build a strong security-focused portfolio
